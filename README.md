# Reddit Ad Filter Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that hides sponsored posts (`<shreddit-ad-post>` elements) on Reddit.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this directory
4. The extension will automatically work when you visit Reddit

## How it works

The extension automatically hides any `<shreddit-ad-post>` elements on Reddit pages. It works with dynamically loaded content, so it will continue to hide ads as you scroll through the feed.
